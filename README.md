# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12

**Description**
WTWR (What to Wear?) is a webpage designed to recommend clothing options based on the current weather, and this is the back-end part of the webpage. The back-end handles the creation, retrieval, and deletion of the site's user data and clothing items cards. The database authenticates user and clothing item info and takes care of all foreseeable errors appropriately. This database also implements the functionality of a like and dislike system for the clothing item images with their own error handling.
